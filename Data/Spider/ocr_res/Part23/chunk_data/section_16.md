# 去过的新地方  

Describe a time when you visited a new place.   
You should say: where the new place was when you went there why you went there   
and explain how you felt about the place.  

# Part 3  

How do people usually feel when they go to a new place? How do children feel when they go to a new school? Why do people usually travel to new cities? Do you think it’s better for old people to travel in a group?
